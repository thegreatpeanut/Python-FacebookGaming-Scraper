# Python-FacebookGaming-Scraper


It's supposed to get the following from a **main URL** and **videos URL** :

* Name 
* Followers 
* Likes on Page 
* Views on Video 
* Age of the Video
* Likes on Video 


and probably more to be added later.


The data this gets will be used in data science ... *eventually*.


Currently it outputs into a CSV the following : **Name | Followers | Page_Likes | Views | Video_Likes**.

Then outputs this the csv data into a postgresql DB.
